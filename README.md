# MuslimNoor-Pro

## Description

MuslimNoor-Pro is a comprehensive Islamic companion app designed to enhance the spiritual journey of Muslims worldwide. Inspired by the popular MuslimPro app, this project aims to provide a better user experience with AI-powered features, cleaner interface, and enhanced functionality.

**Motivation:** To create a modern, intelligent Islamic app that combines traditional Islamic practices with cutting-edge technology, providing Muslims with personalized spiritual guidance and seamless worship assistance.

**Why I built this:** Existing Islamic apps often lack personalization and modern AI features. MuslimNoor-Pro bridges this gap by offering AI-powered Islamic guidance, smart prayer reminders, and a more intuitive user experience.

**Problem it solves:** 
- Provides accurate prayer times and Qibla direction
- Offers personalized Islamic learning and spiritual guidance
- Eliminates ads and distractions during worship
- Delivers AI-powered answers to Islamic questions

**What I learned:** Full-stack development with React/TypeScript, Islamic calculation algorithms, AI integration with OpenAI API, and modern web development best practices.
